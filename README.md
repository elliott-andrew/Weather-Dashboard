# Weather Dashboard

## My Task
Develop an app using the OpenWeather AP to provide the weather outlook for multiple cities. For this activity, parameters were to present the users desired city's current and future conditions and store those cities locally for future reference. The data displayed should be the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. A 5-day forecast with the average daily temperature, humidity level, and date is also presented to the user.
